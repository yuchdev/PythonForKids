# Session 2: Python Syntax and Variables - Cracking the Code

# Activity 1: The Secret Decoder Ring

# Let's create a secret decoder ring with Python!

# Create a variable called 'message' and assign it a secret message (a string)
message = "Python is awesome!"

# Print the message on the screen
print(message)

# Run your code in PyCharm to reveal the secret message!
# Encourage kids to customize their messages and print multiple lines.

# Activity 2: Numeric Adventures

# In the magical numeric land, Python explorers can perform amazing calculations!

# Create numeric variables and perform basic arithmetic operations
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

# Addition
result_add = num1 + num2
print("Addition:", result_add)

# Subtraction
result_sub = num1 - num2
print("Subtraction:", result_sub)

# Multiplication
result_mul = num1 * num2
print("Multiplication:", result_mul)

# Division
result_div = num1 / num2
print("Division:", result_div)

# Create a "Numeric Challenge" - calculate the number of candies needed for a party and print the result!

# Activity 3: String Scavenger Hunt

# Get ready for a "String Scavenger Hunt"!

# Provide a Python string with scrambled words
scrambled_string = "oytnPh si emaosw!"

# Access individual characters in a string and print them
unscrambled_string = ""
for char in scrambled_string:
    if char.isalpha():
        unscrambled_string += char

print("Unscrambled message:", unscrambled_string)

# The hidden message is revealed: "Python is awesome!"

# Encourage kids to create their own scrambled messages for friends.

# Activity 4: The Variable Swap Game

# Welcome to the Variable Swap Game!

# Let's create characters (e.g., Alice and Bob) and practice swapping their hats (variables).

# Create variables for Alice and Bob's hats
alice_hat = "Red"
bob_hat = "Blue"

# Demonstrate how to swap values
temp = alice_hat
alice_hat = bob_hat
bob_hat = temp

# Who can swap hats the fastest?
# Allow kids to create their own characters and practice swapping hats in Python code.

# Activity 5: Interactive Quiz Show

# It's time for an Interactive Quiz Show!

# Host a quiz show with questions related to Python syntax and variables.
# Kids can take turns answering questions using Python code.

# Example quiz question:
# What will this code print? (Kids can use Python to find the answer)
num = 10
num = num * 2
print(num)

# Reward correct answers with virtual "Python Coins" or other small rewards.

# Activity 6: Wrap-up and Homework

# In this session, we learned about Python syntax and variables.

# Homework:
# Create a Python program that calculates and prints your age in dog years.
# Remember, 1 human year is equivalent to 7 dog years.

# Encourage kids to explore more Python code examples online and practice their skills.
