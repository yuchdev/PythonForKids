# Session 3: Input and Output - Text Adventure Time

# Activity 1: The Magical Doorway

# Imagine a magical doorway that leads to adventures! 
# Let's create a text-based adventure game where the player chooses which door to enter.

# Teach how to use input() to get user input and store it in a variable.
player_name = input("Welcome, brave adventurer! What's your name? ")

# Provide a basic game outline where they can choose door options and receive different outcomes.
print(f"Hello, {player_name}! You stand before three doors. Choose wisely!")

door_choice = input("Which door will you enter? (1, 2, or 3): ")

if door_choice == "1":
    print("You've entered the enchanted forest. The trees whisper ancient secrets.")
elif door_choice == "2":
    print("You've stepped into a fiery volcano. It's hot in here!")
else:
    print("You've opened a treasure chest filled with gold. You're rich!")

# Activity 2: Choose Your Adventure

# Encourage kids to come up with their own adventure scenarios.
# Teach how to use conditional statements (if-elif-else) to create branching paths in their games.
# Help them incorporate user input to make decisions within their adventures.

# Activity 3: Adding Flavor Text

# Teach the importance of descriptive text to set the scene and build the story.
# Guide them on how to print descriptive messages and outcomes based on the user's choices.
# Encourage creativity in writing text that immerses the player in the adventure.

# Activity 4: Creating Challenges

# Explain that every adventure needs challenges and obstacles.
# Teach them how to use variables to keep track of the player's progress and choices.
# Show how to use loops to create challenges like puzzles, mazes, or riddles.

# Activity 5: Test and Play Games

# Have kids take turns sharing their text-based adventure games with each other.
# Encourage them to play each other's games and provide feedback.
# Emphasize the importance of user experience and engaging storytelling.

# Activity 6: Game Showcase

# Invite kids to present their games to the class.
# Discuss what they learned from designing their adventures and how they handled input and output.
# Applaud their creativity and problem-solving skills.

# Activity 7: Homework Assignment

# Assign a homework task where they need to improve or expand their adventure games.
# Encourage them to add more branching paths, challenges, and descriptive text.

# Enjoy your adventure game development, young Python explorers!
