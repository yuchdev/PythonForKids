# Session 4: Understanding Data - Data Explorers

# Activity 1: Data Types Expedition

# Let's embark on a Data Types Expedition!

# Introduce the concept of data types: numbers (integers and floats) and strings.
# Explain that data types are like different treasures to be discovered.

# Provide examples of each data type and ask kids to identify them:

# Integer Examples
integer_example1 = 42
integer_example2 = 10
integer_example3 = -5

# Float Examples
float_example1 = 3.14
float_example2 = 2.5
float_example3 = -0.5

# String Examples
string_example1 = "Hello"
string_example2 = "Python"
string_example3 = "Adventure"

# Activity 2: The Data Treasure Hunt

# Welcome to the Data Treasure Hunt!

# Transform the classroom or learning space into a treasure hunt scene.
# Scatter cards with numbers, floats, and strings around the room.

# Equip the kids with "Data Explorer" hats (simple paper hats they can decorate).

# In teams or individually, they must find and collect the cards, sorting them into categories (numbers, floats, and strings).

# Each card they find earns them "Data Coins."

# Activity 3: Operation Challenges

# It's time for some Operation Challenges!

# Introduce the concept of operations:

# Integer Operations
result_add = integer_example1 + integer_example2
result_sub = integer_example1 - integer_example3
result_mul = integer_example2 * integer_example3

# Float Operations
result_div = float_example1 / float_example2
result_float_mul = float_example2 * float_example3

# Advanced Examples
result_square = integer_example1 ** 2
result_square_root = float_example1 ** 0.5

# Create "Operation Challenges" where they need to use their collected data cards to solve problems.

# For example, they could add two number cards, multiply a number by a float card, or raise a number to the square power.

# Each solved challenge earns them more "Data Coins."

# Activity 4: Trading and Upgrading

# Let's trade and upgrade our data cards!

# Explain that with their earned "Data Coins" they can trade and upgrade their data cards.

# Set up a "Data Exchange" station where they can exchange one data type for another or upgrade a number to a float.

# Encourage strategic trading to obtain the data types needed for upcoming challenges.

# Activity 5: Data Relay Race

# Get ready for the Data Relay Race!

# Organize a relay race where teams must complete data-related challenges.

# For example, they may need to concatenate two string cards, raise a number to the square, or find the square root of a float card.

# The first team to complete all challenges wins the "Data Cup."

# Activity 6: Wrap-up and Reflection

# Gather the kids and discuss what they've learned about data types and operations.

# Ask them to share their favorite challenges and what they found interesting.

# Highlight that data is everywhere, and they've become skilled "Data Explorers."

# Congratulations, young Data Explorers, on your successful data expedition!
