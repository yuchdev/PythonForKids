## Session 13: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - The World of Classes and Objects

**Objective:**

In this session, kids will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including what OOP is, how classes and objects work, and how to create and use objects. Understanding OOP is essential as it enables them to create organized, reusable, and efficient code by modeling real-world entities as objects with attributes and behaviors.

#### Activity 1: What Is OOP?

* Begin by explaining that Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that models real-world entities as objects with attributes (data) and behaviors (functions/methods).
* Use analogies like cars (objects) with properties (color, model) and actions (start, stop) to illustrate OOP.

#### Activity 2: Classes and Objects Defined

* Define the concepts of classes and objects:* Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods objects of that class will have.
* Object: An instance of a class. Objects are created based on the class blueprint and have their own unique data and behaviors.

#### Activity 3: Creating a Simple Class

* Introduce kids to the concept of a class by creating a simple class together.
* For example, create a "Person" class with attributes like name and age and methods like "introduce" and "celebrate_birthday."

#### Activity 4: Instantiating Objects

* Teach kids how to create objects (instances) from a class.
* Show them how to use the class blueprint to create multiple person objects with different attributes (names and ages).

#### Activity 5: Using Object Methods

* Explain how objects can have methods (functions) that can perform actions specific to that object.
* Demonstrate how to call object methods to make the person objects introduce themselves and celebrate birthdays.

#### Activity 6: The "Robot Constructor" Game

* Create a game where kids play "Robot Constructors."* Each kid or pair can design their own robot class with unique attributes and behaviors.
* They'll create robot objects based on their class and demonstrate the robot's actions.
* This game reinforces the concepts of classes, objects, and object methods.

#### Activity 7: Discussion and Reflection

* Gather the kids for a discussion on OOP, classes, and objects.
* Ask them to share their experiences in creating and using objects.
* Discuss how OOP can model real-world scenarios efficiently.

**Assessment:**

Assessment is based on understanding of OOP concepts, successful creation and use of objects, and creativity in designing the robot class and objects.

## Session 14: More about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Exploring Methods, Attributes, Inheritance, and Polymorphism

**Objective:**

During this session kids will dive deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by exploring methods, attributes, inheritance, and polymorphism. They will practice these concepts to reinforce their understanding.

#### Activity 1: Review of Methods and Attributes

* Start with a quick review of methods (functions associated with objects) and attributes (object properties/data).
* Discuss how methods allow objects to perform actions, and attributes store information about objects.

#### Activity 2: Inheritance Explained

* Introduce the concept of inheritance in OOP.
* Explain that inheritance allows one class (the subclass or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the superclass or parent class).
* Use examples like animals (superclass: "Animal," subclasses: "Dog," "Cat") to illustrate inheritance.

#### Activity 3: Creating a Class Hierarchy

* Work together to create a simple class hierarchy with a superclass and subclasses.
* For instance, create a "Vehicle" superclass with attributes like "color" and "speed" and create subclasses like "Car" and "Bicycle."

#### Activity 4: Practice with Inheritance

* Encourage kids to create their class hierarchies and practice inheritance.
* They can choose any real-world theme for their classes (e.g., vehicles, animals, fruits).
* Demonstrate how to override (customize) inherited methods in subclasses to give them unique behaviors.

#### Activity 5: Polymorphism Explained

* Introduce the concept of polymorphism, which means "many shapes" in Greek.
* Explain that polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
* Use an example like different shapes (circles, squares) that all have a "calculate_area" method.

#### Activity 6: Implementing Polymorphism

* Show how polymorphism works by creating a program where different objects of subclasses are treated as objects of the superclass.
* For example, create a program that calculates the total area of various shapes (circles, squares, triangles) using polymorphism.

#### Activity 7: The "Inheritance Challenge"

* Create a challenge where kids explore and demonstrate the use of inheritance and polymorphism.
* Provide a list of classes (superclasses and subclasses) with different attributes and methods.
* Ask them to design and demonstrate a scenario where these classes interact using inheritance and polymorphism.

#### Activity 8: Discussion and Reflection

* Gather the kids for a discussion on methods, attributes, inheritance, and polymorphism in OOP.
* Ask them to share their experiences in creating class hierarchies and using polymorphism.
* Discuss how OOP concepts can help model complex real-world relationships.

**Assessment:**

Assessment is based on understanding of OOP concepts, successful creation of class hierarchies, and the ability to demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism in the "Inheritance Challenge.
