## Dictionaries (Dicts)

**What is a Dictionary (Dict)?**

Think of a dictionary like a phone book. In a phone book, you look up a name (like "Mom") and find a number (like her
phone number). In programming, a dictionary is a way to store pairs of things, like names and phone numbers.

**How to Use Dictionaries:**

**Making a Dictionary:** You can make a dictionary using curly braces { } and separating pairs with colons. For example:

```python
phone_book = {"Mom": "123-456-7890", "Dad": "987-654-3210", "Friend": "555-123-4567"}
```

**Accessing Information:** You can ask for someone's number by using their name, just like looking up a name in a phone
book:

```python
print(phone_book["Mom"])
```

**Adding and Changing Entries:** You can add new names and numbers or change the ones you have:

```python
phone_book["Aunt"] = "456-789-0123"
phone_book["Friend"] = "555-987-6543"
```

Compare to lists:

* Lists are like rows of your favorite things, where you can add, remove, and find things by their position.
* Dictionaries (Dicts) are like phone books, where you find information by looking up a name and can add or change entries.
