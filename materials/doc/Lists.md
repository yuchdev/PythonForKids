## Lists

**What is a List?**

Imagine you have a collection of your favorite toys or books. You put them all in a row so you can see them easily. In programming, a list is like that row of toys or books. It's a way to keep a bunch of things together, like a list of your favorite games or colors.

**How to Use Lists:**

**Making a List:** You can make a list in programming by putting things inside square brackets `[ ]` and separating them with commas. For example:

```python
favorite_games = ["Minecraft", "Fortnite", "Roblox"]
```

**Accessing Items:** You can ask for a specific thing in your list by using its position, like asking for the first book in your row. In programming, we start counting from 0. So, to get the first item in our list:

```python
print(favorite_games[0])
```

**Adding and Removing:** You can add more games to your list or take some out. It's like adding a new toy or giving one away. In programming:
    
```python
favorite_games.append("Among Us")
favorite_games.remove("Fortnite")
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
